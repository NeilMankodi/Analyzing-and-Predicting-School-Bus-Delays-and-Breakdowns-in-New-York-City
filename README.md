# Analyzing-and-Predicting-School-Bus-Delays-and-Breakdowns-in-New-York-City

We analyze data containing information on breakdowns and delays for school buses in
New York City. Our analysis is in three parts: First, we try to predict whether incidents are likely
due to breakdowns or delays, based on several (largely categorical) features. Subsequently, we
build models that are capable of incorporating these results for predicting delay times. Lastly, we
offer an alternative time-series-based approach to delay prediction which relies more heavily on
locational and temporal data. In a congested metropolis area like New York City, reliable
transportation for students can be a problem and incidents are frequent. Understanding the
immediate impact of incidents when they occur is therefore a crucial tool for any efficient
transportation system.
